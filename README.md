# Starter project for static site using Eleventy

This is a startup project based on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io), a great and simple Static Site Generator.

The configuration of this work environment includes:

- A scaffold to start building quickly with Eleventy.
- Webpack configuration for development and production environments.
- Preprocessing SASS files to CSS.
- Babel for compiler modern Javascript.
- Nunjuck configuration as template engine.
- Compile from Vue Single File Components.
- CSS and Javascript minified bundles.
- Asset management and optimization.
- Configuration file for publish in Netlify.



### Install

```
$ npm i
```

### Development Mode

```
$ npm run dev
```

Development mode runs a local web server with hot-reloading function at http: // localhost: 8080

### Production Mode

The production mode generates precompiled templates, optimized CSS styles and javascript files building the website ready for publication in the ```/dist``` folder.

```
$ npm run build
```

### Netlify functions

ItÂ´s possible to run and test our lambda functions in the local development environment without the need to publish or deploy. To do this we will globally install the Netlify CLI with the following command:

```
$ npm i -g netlify-cli
```

Once installed we can run the Netlify development environment:

```
$ netlify dev
```

To execute our function we will access to the path:

```
/localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/{{FUNCTION_NAME}}
```
